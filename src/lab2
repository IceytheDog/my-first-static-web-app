<p>Coding</p>
<p>On April 6th, 2014 emergency services were unavailable for over 11 million people. During these six hours the entirety of the State of Washington was cut off from police, fire, and emergency medical care, all because a simple software error was made years earlier during the coding of a computer in a call center hundreds of miles away. This accident was catastrophic and terrifying for those affected, but the most frightening aspect of this incident was that it was not a targeted attempt to destabilize emergency services in the State of Washington, instead it was a simple, accidental software mistake. If incidents like this persist, however rare they are, the modern world could rapidly fall victim to the destabilization of its virtual infrastructure.</p>
<p>When compared to other fields of study, such as engineering or biology, computer science is certainly in its infancy. While coding originated in the 19th century with Charles Babbage&rsquo;s and Ada Lovelace&rsquo;s invention of the Analytical Engine, modern coding languages and machine learning are far from completely understood. This allows for routine discovery of new ways in which to approach coding problems, but this also creates the potential for a multitude of new issues within the coding space. For example, only one third of one percent of people know how to code, and very few even know what coding is. This lack of understanding of what is, potentially, the most powerful tool and weapon in the modern world is already resulting in more problems for the average person. Problems which are occurring with increasing regularity and severity in part because there is a lack of diversity within the coding space, with most computer scientists being white males. Netflix&rsquo;s &ldquo;Coding Explained&rdquo; argues that this lack of diversity is already resulting in a closed off network of middle aged white males who are again controlling a new field. However, this problem is not without hope. As evidenced on the fourth episode of the CodeNewbie podcast (which is hosted by women), coding is not impossible to break into as a woman or person of color. In this episode, the topic of diversity was discussed by Kinsey Ann Durham, a self taught coder based in California. She was able to provide a unique viewpoint on the issues currently affecting the coding world, such as lack of racial and gender diversity, and the currently linear and strict path into computer science expertise. On the issue of diversity she hypothesized that the currently limited demographics of computer scientists has caused a restrictive &ldquo;boy&rsquo;s club&rdquo; within the computer science field. To remedy this she recommended more computer science classes with less restrictive prerequisites marketed towards women and people of color. Her unique view on these issues is directly related to some of the topics mentioned in Netflix&rsquo;s &ldquo;Coding Explained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After &ldquo;Coding Explained&rdquo; covered the origins of coding and computer science with the Analytical Engine, the show heavily utilized infographics to provide evidence for why and how morse code became the first coding language, also known as binary (1s and 0s). The hosts of the show coupled these infographics with interviews of computer scientists to explain how morse code and the binary language is essentially the bridge between machine and human language. The show then provides a brief history of binary, emphasizing how quickly binary evolved to the point of assisting in the creation of the fusion bomb. A computer using binary language was able to do in six weeks what the most distinguished mathematicians couldn&rsquo;t in years. This section of the show seemed to be focused on emphasizing to power of coding by using footage of atomic bomb explosions and the wreckage of WWII Hiroshima and Nagasaki after the bombs were dropped. Ominous music played, and the narrator alluded to what could happen should coders with the wrong motivation be given the budget and ability to operate with impunity. I believe &ldquo;Coding Explained&rdquo; succeeded in showing the power and importance of even early coding languages, such as binary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While it was only 25 minutes long, &ldquo;Coding: Explained&rdquo; managed to fit a large amount of information into each section it covered. It primarily relied on using first hand accounts, interviews with computer scientists, and other forms of media to provide evidence for its various points. A large amount of the episode was focused on the evolution of coding languages, and I believe this is where the show was most successful. It began the second half of the episode by explaining the basics of various coding languages. Firstly, it explained how the abstraction a coding language possesses is positively correlated to the level of depth and specificity of a coding language. This stems from the infinite continuation of creation of new coding languages, because as technology becomes more advanced, so do coding languages. The languages were ranked on a well-designed, colorful chart and in order from least to most abstract it went computer mechanics, binary, assembly languages, high level languages, GUI&rsquo;s, and finally machine learning. In my opinion, this was one of the most influential points made during the episode. As someone who finds it easier to learn from visual representation, the chart was more digestible for me. From this point on, the episode was focused on GUI&rsquo;s (Graphical User Interfaces) and machine learning. GUI&rsquo;s are essentially a new technology which was designed to make coding simpler and more accessible for the average person. Developed by Xeroxin the 1970&rsquo;s, GUI&rsquo;s began as an alternative to writing code (physically or virtually) and instead utilizes a series of shortcuts, written in normal english, to allow average people to begin coding, and enhance the speed at which computer scientists can complete their work. The idea quickly took off and was soon adopted as a viable alternative to traditional coding. As another primary point in the episode, GUI&rsquo;s were explained with the usual infographics and interviews, but for this explanation the show used a first hand interview with the creator of GUI&rsquo;s. This provided a unique perspective on the issue, as the viewer was granted knowledge of how and why the idea was hypothesized, rather than speculation on its origin. Soon after, the episode again changed direction towards, arguably, its most important issue, machine learning. Machine learning was explained as &ldquo;the process of using mathematical models of data to help a computer learn without direct instruction. It&rsquo;s considered a subset of artificial intelligence (AI). Machine learning uses algorithms to identify patterns within data, and those patterns are then used to create a data model that can make predictions. (Azure.Microsoft).&rdquo; This is the most important topic in the episode. Machine learning is rapidly taking over the global cyber space. Traditional code writers are turning into machine learning engineers, and machine learning is becoming the status quo for new technology. The greatest issue with machine learning is the lack of diversity in its field, as well as the overall lack of understanding of the field by the average person. As this pertains to one of the most rapidly growing fields of study, more attention should be placed upon this. In order to remedy this we must open the computer science and coding field to more diverse groups to avoid any potential exclusion and promote understanding of cultures.</p>
